My first original video game | made in SFML and Visual Studio
Play the game by clicking the .exe file in either the debug or release folders.  Do not take them out of their folders.
Intro: Wait for the intro to be over to play the game.
Title Screen: Left click with the mouse or press enter to start.  Press backspace to go back.  Press escape to close the game.
Game: Click all 9 red circles to make them disappear.  If one hits you, left click with the mouse to try again.  If you click them all, you win.
Outro: If you complete the game fast enough, you will be presented with the outro, followed by the game closing.
